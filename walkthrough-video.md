Notes towards a re-recording of the Walkthrough/Demonstration Video.

# Preparing the Video/Editing
- I want to be able to record myself
- I want some basic video editing software to crop
- I want smart slides between sections (maybe that thing suraj uses)

# Sections
- Installation (Prerequisites -> Clone the Repo -> Install -> Test (?))
- Usage
- Repository walkthrough (?)
- Key features / what does this demonstrate
- Further development and contribution
- Contact
