Notes towards a re-recording of the Walkthrough/Demonstration Video.

# Preparing the Video/Editing
- I want to be able to record myself
- I want some basic video editing software to crop
- I want smart slides between sections (maybe that thing Suraj uses)

# Sections
- Introduction
- Installation (Prerequisites (node/npm) -> Clone the Repo -> Install -> Test (?))
- Usage
- Repository walkthrough (?)
- Key features / what does this demonstrate
- Further development and contribution
- Contact
- Link to other two most relevant repos

# Introduction
- Introduce as Quick and README - and explain what it is
- Produced for the coding Bootcamp
- Tidied and refactored as a portfolio project
- What the video will do
- Try to keep to 30 - 45 seconds (?), 5-10 min video total
