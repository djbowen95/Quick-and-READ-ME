<h1 align="center"> üèÉ Quick and READ ME! üìù</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Command-Line README Generator. <i> Version 1.0.1 </i> </h2>
<p><strong>Quick and READ ME!</strong> is an easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) that helps a user create a quick, professional README file in markdown format. It was created in <em><strong>Node.js</strong></em>, with the <em><strong>Inquirer</strong></em>, <em><strong>fs</strong></em> and <em><strong>path</strong></em> node packages, using <strong><em>JavaScript ES6+</em></strong> syntax features including modularization and asynchronous functions.

This project was created for the <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926">University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Education Web Development Coding Bootcamp</a></strong>, during <strong>Week 9</strong> (<strong>Node.js, ES6+ and back-end development</strong>). To get started, I'd suggest you either:
 * Take a look at the [project history](#project-history) for a more detailed summary of what we were learning this week, or;
 * Take a look at the [technology stack](#technology-stack) to see how I used technologies that were new to me that week to solve a given brief.

This was created as a <strong><a href="https://github.com/djbowen95">portfolio project</a></strong>. If you'd like to use the application however, feel free! Take a look at the  [installation instructions](#install) to get started. I also still have a few ideas for how I could improve this project, so <strong>if you are a junior developer interested in collaborating</strong>, please get in touch using [the contact details below](#contact).</p>

## Project History
### üè´ Introducing the Bootcamp!
#### What did I learn on the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp, and when?
This project was created for the <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926">University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Education Web Development Coding Bootcamp</a></strong>, which I was enrolled on between November 2021 and June 2022. This intensive 24-week course taught us the fundamental skills we would need to become a full-stack developer, including:
* Front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; with modern web development principles including responsive design;
* Front-end frameworks, with a special focus on building projects with <strong>React</strong>;
* Back-end development using <strong>Node.js</strong>; 
* <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> and GraphQL APIs; interacting with third-party APIs and building own APIs from scratch; 
* Database management with both <strong>SQL</strong> and NoSQL databases, including ODM and ORM;
* Version control with <strong>Git</strong>.

This course consisted of ten hours per week of in-person tuition, supplemented with roughly 20 hours of independent study. We learned at least one new technology or critical concept each week, and were immediately tasked to apply that to a real world project. 

This is the project we were tasked to build in Week 9, which was focused on Node.js, ES6+ and back-end development fundamentals. You can view the brief for the project [here](./docs/BRIEF.md).
### Week 9: Node.js, ES6+ and back-end development
#### What were the key concepts learned for this week of the bootcamp?
Little bit of text here to test the format.
### Learning Outcomes
#### What did I learn from building this project, and what would I like to improve?

### Feedback
#### What feedback did I get for this project from the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Education?

## Testing
There are no tests for this project at the current time. It was built using manual testing, running the application with each change and logging errors to the console.

I have covered unit tests and test driven-development with my other projects. Take a look at the [Team Profile Builder](https://github.com/djbowen95/Team-Profile-Builder) and the [Word Guessing Game](https://github.com/djbowen95/GuessingGame) to see examples of this.

I like building unit tests and hope to be able to add them in for all my applications at some point in time. I was unfortunately limited as this project was designed and built in a week.

## Version History
#### 1.0.1 Updated README, Portfolio Version
Major refactor of the README file and related documentation. This was done in parallel to updates on my other bootcamp projects, to improve my portfolio.
#### 1.0.0, Bootcamp Release
This is the version of the project as it was when I submitted it to examiners. It was built in a week, to a tight deadline and in order to meet a given brief.
